                    "Five years ago, I enrolled in an advanced painting class at the San Francisco Art Institute
                    through its Adult Continuing Education Program. I hadn't painted much since college where
                    I managed to only fit in three art classes in four years otherwise filled with physics,
                    chemistry and geology classes. But a decade later, in an art studio whose ghosts included
                    Richard Diebenkorn and Elmer Bischoff, I picked up a paintbrush, and began painting."</p>

                    emulsion and plasticizers, silicone oils, defoamers, stabilizers, or metal soaps.
                    Most acrylic paints are water-based</p>
