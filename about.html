                    Nice to meet you!<br> 
                    If you haven't already guessed, my name is Matilda!
                    I'm 22 years old, born and raised in Skövde, Sweden.
                    Ever since I was a little kid have I loved to paint and be creative as many children does, however
                    my love affair with painting never stopped.</p>
                    <p class="about-text">
                    Little more than two years ago I attended a course in Illustration painting from Berghs Scool of
                    Communication in Stockholm, and I've been hooked ever since!
                    The last couple of years has been devoted to finding new ways and techniques to paint, and
                    continuing on my creative path, hopefully I can inspire you to be creative to!</p>
