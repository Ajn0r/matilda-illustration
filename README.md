# Matilda illustration

For the first Portfolio Project with Code Institute, I have created a portfolio website for my friend Matilda who makes illustrations and paints acrylics.

For the live site please click [here](https://ajn0r.github.io/matilda-illustration/)

## Who is the website for?

It’s a website where the user can get to know Matilda and what she does, get inspired and view her work. It is also a good way for the user to be able to get in touch with the artist. The artist is based in Sweden but can send illustrations electronicky if the user would like to purchase one.

## The owner

The owner of the page is Matilda Andersson – The artist.
The goal of the owner is to showcase her work, inspire visitors, get more followers on her social media and to receive orders for custom paintings.

## What does it do?

The website serves as a portfolio for the artist, it serves people searching for inspiration and also people looking to order a custom painting with information of what they can expect. It is also an easy way to get in contact with Matilda for questions, orders or anything else the user would like to get in contact for.
