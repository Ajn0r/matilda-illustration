## Who is the website for?

It’s a website for the art interested person, where the user can get to know Matilda and what she does, get inspired and view her work. It is also a good way for the user to be able to get in touch with the artist. 
The website is also for the artist, it's her portfolio website.
The artist is based in Sweden but can send illustrations electronicallyß if the user would like to purchase one.

## The owner

The owner of the page is Matilda Andersson – The artist.
The goal of the owner is to showcase her work, inspire visitors, get more followers on her social media and to receive orders for custom paintings.

## What does it do?

The website serves as a portfolio for the artist, it serves people searching for inspiration and also people looking to order a custom painting with information of what they can expect. It is also an easy way to get in contact with Matilda for questions, orders or anything else the user would like to get in contact for.

## Feauters

The project includes several feauters:

- 7 pages in total
- 4 different menu options
- 2 different selection from gallery page
- One contact form with a “dummy” page for when its recived
- link to instagram
- several links on the about page, making the navigation easy and effective

### Structure

- The website consists of a of total 7 different pages and four different menu options.

Two of the pages is under-categories of the Gallery page and can be found from the gallery page or the about page.

The 7th page is a “dummy” page, which displays when the user fills in and submit the form on the contact page, giving a clear message of that the form has been received.
The pages are laid out in a logical way, making it easily navigated for the user.
The about, gallery and contact page all share the same background image, so it provides a sense of familiarity for the user, and making it clear which is the homepage. 

#### Navigation & Footer

- The navigation and footer are the same on all the pages, making the navigation easy for the user.  
On small screens the navigation is stacking in a column format instead of row, making it easier to use on mobile screens and other small screens.
The footer consists of one line with icons which is linked to the different social media platforms, if the users click on them, they will open in a new tab.

Navigation menu on larger screens, the page that the user is currently on has an underline, and when hovered the link change color to pink and it also gets an underline.

The image shows that the user is on the home page, and are hovering over the gallery page.

The footer consist of 3 clickable symbols for social media platforms, Facebook, Instagram and Twitter, all opening in a new tab.
There is a hover effect so that the icon changes color when the user hover it.

## Wireframes

Wireframes were made for each of the pages, both for desktop and mobile.
A slight change on the about page was done after the wireframes, and that was the "latest work" section with the link to the artist instagram.

### Color & Fonts

### Colors

I have found the colors for the website on Coolors.co

![Colors](assets/documentation/coolors.png)

Since all of the pages have a background I decided to go with different scales of black and white and also a nice pink color 

### Fonts

I have found my fonts on Google Font, the ones that i finally decided to use are:

- 'Permantent Marker'
For header logo and also headings on main and about page

- 'Noto Serif'
For all other text

## Feautures I would like to implement in the future

It is hard knowing when to stop, the finished website today is where I had to draw a line in order to reach my submission date. There is however a few things I would like to implement in the future, some I will need more knowledge before I can implement, for others I just need more time.

- Drop down menu for small screens instead of the column version.
- Connect the contact form to Matildas email.
- Add a file type input on the form, if the user wants to order a painting, they can easily submit a image for the artist to paint by directly in the form.
- Embedd the artists Instagram page on the about page instead of the "My latest work" text.
- Im sure some of the text on the site could be improved as english is not my native language.

## Testing

### Browser testing

Browsers that the website has been tested on: 

- Google Chrome
- Windows Edge
- Safari
- Firefox

#### Issues

One issue on older Safari browsers is that webp format images are not supported, at least not on my old macbook. 
Testing to not format images to make it work on older versions of safari did not weigh up to the advantages of webp formats, since the website hold many images and safari has supported webp since 2020,all that is needed is an update of safari. 

### Lighthouse



### Validators

The W3C Markup validator and W3C CSS validator Services has been used to validate each page of the website to ensure that there were no errors in the code.

![Validated](assets/documentation/html-check-about.png)
![Validated index](assets/documentation/html-check-index.png)
![Css validated](assets/documentation/css-validator.png)

### Local testing

Local testing of all links, contact form and functionallaty of the website has been done.
A bug was discovered when trying to reach the contact page from the about page, it was missing an update of the href from # to the actual file.

### Responsivness

The Chrome developer tool have been used extensively to check the responsivness of the website.
Firefox developer tool have been used at the end stage for validate it looks good in other browsers aswell.

#### Issues

- Testing the responsivness in Chrome and Edge looked good, however, on screens smaller than 850px in firefox and on iphone, the nav was hidden by the main image.

Using the inspector on firefox made me discover the problem, I had set the max-height for the header to be 16vh, and tried to get the navbar to fit using margin-top, which didn't do the trick. The problem was resolved by removing the max-height on the header.

## Technologies and resources used

I have used:

- HTML5 for markup
- CSS3 for style
- Google Fonts for fonts

- TinyPng for some of the images resizing
- Coolors.co for colors
- Font Awesome for icons
- Favicon.io for the favicon
- Git for version control
- Github for keeping the files, documents and depolyment of the site
- Kevin Powell's Youtube channel for learning the basics of CSS grid & flexbox.

## The future for the website

As a friend of the artist I will continue to expand the features described in the feauture section and design of the webpage as my knowledge grows.
It is also a goal to deploy the website on a custom domain in the future
