# Matilda illustration

For the first Portfolio Project with Code Institute, I have created a portfolio website for my friend Matilda who makes illustrations and paints acrylics.

For the live site please click [here](https://ajn0r.github.io/matilda-illustration/)

## Who is the website for?

It’s a website for the art interested person, where the user can get to know Matilda and what she does, get inspired and view her work. It is also a good way for the user to be able to get in touch with the artist. The artist is based in Sweden but can send illustrations electronicky if the user would like to purchase one.

## The owner

The owner of the page is Matilda Andersson – The artist.
The goal of the owner is to showcase her work, inspire visitors, get more followers on her social media and to receive orders for custom paintings.

## What does it do?

The website serves as a portfolio for the artist, it serves people searching for inspiration and also people looking to order a custom painting with information of what they can expect. It is also an easy way to get in contact with Matilda for questions, orders or anything else the user would like to get in contact for.

## UX 5 Planes

### Strategy Plane

### Scope Plane

The project includes several feauters:

- 7 pages in total
- 4 different menu options
- 2 different selection from gallery page
- One contact form with a “dummy” page for when its recived
- link to instagram
- several links on the about page, making the navigation easy and effective

### Structure Plane

- The website consists of a of total 7 different pages and four different menu options.

Two of the pages is under-categories of the Gallery page and can be found from the gallery page or the about page.

The 7th page is a “dummy” page, which displays when the user fills in and submit the form on the contact page, giving a clear message of that the form has been received.
The pages are laid out in a logical way, making it easily navigated for the user.
The about, gallery and contact page all share the same background image, so it provides a sense of familiarity for the user, and making it clear which is the homepage. 

#### Navigation & Footer

- The navigation and footer are the same on all the pages, making the navigation easy for the user.  
On small screens the navigation is stacking in a column format instead of row, making it easier to use on mobile screens and other small screens.
The footer consists of one line with icons which is linked to the different social media platforms, if the users click on them, they will open in a new tab.

#### Home page

- The home page consists of a background image and a welcome fraise, with a link that invites the user to know the artist better

#### About page

- The about page lets the user know some information about the artist, who she is, what she does, how to order a custom painting and where the user can view the artist latest works.
It also has 4 different links, 3 leading to other pages on the website, and one to the artist Instagram, which opens in a new tab.
It provides an image of the artist on large screens and also change layout using grid, on smallest screens the image is hidden, and information shown in a column direction.

#### Fonts

I have found my fonts on Google Font, the ones that i finally decided to use are:

- 'Permantent Marker'
For header logo and also headings on main and about page

- 'Noto Serif'
For all other text

## Feautures I would like to implement in the future

- Drop down menu for small screens
- 

## Testing

### Browser testing

- Google Chrome
- Windows Edge
- Safari
- Firefox

### Validators



### Local testing

### Responsivness

- Testing the responsivness in Chrome and Edge looked good, however, on screens smaller than 850px in firefox and on iphone, the nav was hidden by the main image.

Using the inspector on firefox made me discover the problem, I had set the max-height for the header to be 16vh, and tried to get the navbar to fit using margin-top, which didn't do the trick.

### Issues

- Testing the responsivness in Chrome and Edge looked good, however, on screens smaller than 850px in firefox and on iphone, the nav was hidden by the main image.


## Technologies Used

I have used:

- HTML5 for markup
- CSS3 for style
